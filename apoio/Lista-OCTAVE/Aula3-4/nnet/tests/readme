tests directory:
================

nnetTest.m:
-----------
Runs all the m-files containing
test cases

test_nnet_win32.pl:
-------------------
Is a perl script. To run this, you must have
installed a perl interpreter. I tested it with
the ActiveState Perl for Win32 systems.
Currently, it does nothing else as nnetTest.m does.



subdirectory MLP:
=================

MLPScripts.m:
-------------
to run some very basic tests please run
MLPScripts. This will run all scripts
inside the subdirectories "example1" and
"example2".
If no error occur, the first test is passed :-)

nnetTestMLP.m
----------
these tests don't run on the windows version of octave-forge.
Please use a linux/unix version. I tested it on octave-3.0.0
compiled on ubuntu.
