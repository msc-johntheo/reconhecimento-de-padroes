%SVDD_OPTRBF  Quadratic optimizer for the SVDD
%
%    [ALF,R2,DX,I] = SVDD_OPTRBF(SIGMA,X,LABX,C)
%
% Quadratic optimizer for the SVDD. Preferably called by svdd.m.
%
% Given the dataset X with labels LABX, and the parameters SIGMA and C the
% quadratic optimization is performed, and the resulting weights ALF and R2
% are returned. Upon request, also the distances of the training objects X to
% the center DX are returned, and the indices of the support vectors I.
