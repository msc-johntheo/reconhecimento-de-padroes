Known problems with PRTools
---------------------------

1. Dataset class and command
----------------------------

An important class in PRTools is 'dataset'. There is a dataset
constructor and there are many overloads. In the recent versions
of Matlab there is another constructor named 'dataset':
./matlab-7.7/toolbox/shared/statslib/@dataset/dataset.m 

This causes clashes with PRTools. The only solutions found sofar
are to remove matlab-7.7/toolbox/shared/statslib from the Matlab
path or move PRTools to the top of the path.


2. Another routine 'map'?
-------------------------
All prtools mappings can be written as A*W, overloading the mtimes 
operator. PRTools starts the execution by its 'map' function: map(A,W).
There are other packages, like Spider, that contain a function called 
'map'. The solution is similar as above: change the path such that 
prtools is above the package, or to delete the package entirely.

3. Wrong or missing mex-files for qld
-------------------------------------
PRTools uses a quadratic optimizer called 'qld'. If it cannot be found
it uses the Matlab function 'quadprog'. Due to changing libraries
caused by system upgrades qld mex-file may crash. Solutions are to
rename it or to delete it, in which case PRTools uses 'quadprog', or
to recompile the source. To do this, change directory to 
prtools/private and run makeqld.

4. Problems with examples
-------------------------
Some examples prex* don't run due to missing datafiles or datasets.
